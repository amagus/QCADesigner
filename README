QCADesigner README Notes
============================

If you would like to run QCADesigner from the source tree,
that is, you do not want to perform "make install", you
may do so by switching to the src/ subdirectory and
running ./QCADesigner .

If you would like to install QCADesigner to a path other
than the default you can run configure with the --prefix
option and specify the path. For example if you are
configuring QCADesigner for the first time, you can run:

./autogen.sh --prefix=<Your path>
make
make install

"ls <Your path>" should show a "bin" and "share" directory
that contain all the files that QCADesigner has installed.
You can then use the script provided above to run
QCADesigner.
